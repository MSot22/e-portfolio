## Introduction
This e-portfolio showcases my learning, professional development, and technical work throughout the *Security and Risk Management* module. It integrates artefacts and reflections that demonstrate progression in identifying, analysing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks within both SME and enterprise contexts.

Two major artefacts underpin this portfolio:
1. **Pampered Pets Risk Identification Report** – a qualitative SME risk assessment applying ISO/IEC 27005, STRIDE, and OCTAVE-S frameworks.  
2. **Cathy’s Digital Transformation Executive Summary** – a quantitative enterprise risk and continuity analysis using FMEA, Monte Carlo simulation, and BC/DR design.  

Together, these projects illustrate my growth from conceptual understanding to analytical precision, reflecting both academic learning and professional application in my current EY role.

## A. Foundations of Risk Management (Units 1–2)
### Artefact: Comparison of Risk and Threat Modelling Frameworks

**Description:**  
During the early phase of the module, I explored multiple frameworks for risk identification and analysis. Using ISO/IEC 27005 (2022) as a foundation, I compared STRIDE and OCTAVE-S to understand how each model supports different organisational scales and threat landscapes.

**Evidence:**  
- Table comparing ISO 27005, STRIDE, and OCTAVE-S methodologies.  
- Summary notes on GDPR (EU, 2016) and PCI DSS (2018) compliance relevance.  

**Reflection:**  
This stage helped establish a structured mindset for security risk management. I learned that ISO 27005 provides a holistic approach linking assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, while STRIDE and OCTAVE-S allow technical and operational depth. Understanding these models guided the methodological design for later projects.

## B. SME Qualitative Risk Assessment – Pampered Pets Project (Units 3–6)
### Artefact: Pampered Pets Risk Identification Report
**Frameworks Used:** ISO/IEC 27005, STRIDE, OCTAVE-S  

**Description:**  
The *Pampered Pets* project focused on analysing risks associated with the company’s move toward digitalisation. I used the ISO 27005 framework to map assets against threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, supported by STRIDE threat modelling to identify potential cyberattack vectors.

**Evidence:**  
- Extracts from Table 2-1 and Table 2-3 (risk register and mitigation strategies).  
- Figure 3-1 (digitalisation threat model diagram).  
- Table 3-2 (OCTAVE-S risk register).  

**Summary of Learning:**  
This exercise improved my ability to integrate qualitative and semi-structured methods in SME risk assessment. I learned to align risk prioritisation with compliance obligations (GDPR, PCI DSS) and business drivers such as customer trust and operational efficiency.

**Reflection:**  
One major insight was understanding how limited resources in SMEs require proportional controls. ISO 27005’s qualitative scoring exposed how risk perception can shift over time, while STRIDE added technical clarity. This project established the conceptual basis for the more quantitative work in Unit 11.

## C. Quantitative Risk and Business Continuity – Cathy’s Digital Transformation (Units 7–11)
### Artefact: Executive Summary for Cathy’s Digital Transformation
**Frameworks Used:** FMEA (IEC 60812), Monte Carlo Simulation, ISO 22301, ISO 27001  

**Description:**  
This project extended my risk management practice to an enterprise-level case. Using FMEA, I quantified risks across automation, supply-chain operations, and cloud infrastructure. Monte Carlo simulation allowed me to model interdependent risk probabilities, producing probabilistic insights into operational failures.

I then proposed a **hybrid AWS–Azure BC/DR architecture** with <1-minute RTO/RPO, meeting GDPR and ISO 22301 standards.

**Evidence:**  
- FMEA table (RPN values for automation, cyberattack, and supply-chain risks).  
- Monte Carlo simulation output summary.  
- BC/DR hybrid cloud diagram.  

**Summary of Learning:**  
This project demonstrated how quantitative analysis strengthens decision-making in cybersecurity and operations. I learned to evaluate dependencies between quality, availability, and compliance, while balancing cost and resilience.

**Reflection:**  
The exercise shifted my perspective from static risk registers to dynamic, data-driven modelling. It emphasised that cybersecurity is not just prevention—it is about ensuring business continuity, resilience, and trust.

## D. Collaboration and Professional Development
**Description:**  
Throughout the module, peer discussions and tutor feedback played a crucial role in improving my analytical clarity. Early feedback encouraged me to integrate more business context into technical risk descriptions. By the end of the module, I learned to balance regulatory, technical, and operational perspectives—a skill directly applicable to my work in EY Technology Risk and Forensics.

**Evidence:**  
- Peer feedback excerpts.  
- Meeting summaries and shared research notes.  

**Reflection:**  
Working collaboratively helped me view security risk not only as a technical problem but as a shared business responsibility. I also developed better time management, self-organisation, and adaptability—important traits for consulting environments.

## E. Project Evaluation (Unit 6 vs Unit 11)
The *Pampered Pets Risk Identification Report* (Unit 6) and the *Cathy’s Digital Transformation Executive Summary* (Unit 11) represent my academic and professional progression in risk analysis. Unit 6’s work centred on qualitative techniques suitable for SMEs, where ISO 27005 and STRIDE allowed structured mapping of threats and vulnerabilities. This phase highlighted my ability to connect compliance frameworks (GDPR, PCI DSS) with operational realities but lacked quantifiable precision.

By Unit 11, I advanced to a data-driven risk approach using FMEA and Monte Carlo simulation. These methods introduced statistical rigour and improved prioritisation accuracy. Designing a hybrid AWS–Azure BC/DR solution demonstrated how theoretical frameworks translate into real-world resilience planning.

Overall, the transition from *Pampered Pets* to *Cathy’s* signifies a move from descriptive to quantitative reasoning, and from academic analysis to professional application. The projects collectively enhanced my capacity to bridge technical insight, business value, and compliance integrity—the foundation of effective cybersecurity consulting.

## F. Reflective Section   

### **WHAT?**
*This module required the completion of two key assessments that collectively developed my capability to identify, analyse, and mitigate information security risks in complex organisational contexts. 

The first project, Pampered Pets Risk Identification Report, focused on a small-to-medium enterprise (SME) facing digital transformation challenges. Using the ISO/IEC 27005:2022 framework and STRIDE threat modelling, I identified technical, operational, and compliance-related risks while proposing controls aligned with GDPR and PCI DSS. Later, I applied the OCTAVE-S framework to assess digitalisation risks, mapping them against business goals and resource constraints.

The second assessment, Executive Summary for Cathy’s Digital Transformation, required a more advanced and quantitative approach. I employed Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) under IEC 60812 and Monte Carlo simulations to model the probability and impact of automation failures, supply-chain disruptions, and cyberattacks in a global luxury brand’s ecosystem. I also designed a hybrid AWS–Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) architecture with <1-minute RTO/RPO, ensuring GDPR and ISO 27001/22301 compliance.

Together, these assessments demonstrated the progression from qualitative to quantitative risk analysis, deepening my understanding of how academic methodologies underpin professional risk management practices. They mirrored real-world challenges I encounter in my current role at EY, bridging theory with applied cybersecurity consulting.

### **SO WHAT?**
*Engaging with both assessments transformed my understanding of how structured frameworks can translate abstract cybersecurity risks into actionable business decisions. Initially, during the Pampered Pets project, I struggled with balancing technical depth and business relevance. Applying ISO 27005 and STRIDE required making subjective judgments about likelihood and impact something I initially found ambiguous. Feedback from my tutor encouraged me to contextualise these risks within the company’s strategic objectives, not just technical vulnerabilities. This feedback pushed me to view risk management as a dynamic process that connects information assurance with organisational resilience.

In contrast, the Cathy’s project required precision and quantifiable justification. The shift to FMEA and Monte Carlo simulation introduced a new level of analytical rigour. I had to validate assumptions statistically and understand interdependencies between automation systems, cloud infrastructures, and human error. This exercise helped me appreciate the value of probabilistic reasoning in risk management and its role in executive decision-making. The process was intellectually demanding but rewarding, particularly when simulating thousands of risk iterations to quantify uncertainty a method I had not previously applied in my professional work.

Emotionally, the iterative nature of both projects initially felt overwhelming. Coordinating multiple frameworks, verifying compliance standards, and interpreting simulation data tested my time management and technical confidence. However, these challenges enhanced my critical thinking and self-efficacy. Collaborating in discussions and comparing models with peers provided reassurance and fostered professional dialogue similar to audit-team briefings at EY.

The experience also reinforced my understanding of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) as the foundation of all risk decisions. Integrating GDPR and ISO 27001/27005 standards highlighted the interplay between legal compliance, technical controls, and business value preservation crucial lessons for a consultant operating within regulated industries. The projects collectively reshaped my professional perspective from viewing cybersecurity as merely technical protection to seeing it as an enabler of trust, continuity, and digital innovation.
*

### **NOW WHAT?**
*This module significantly influenced my ongoing professional development as a Technology Risk and Forensics Staff at EY. The practical and theoretical insights gained will directly inform my work in risk assessment, audit engagements, and security advisory projects. In particular, the application of ISO 27005, OCTAVE-S, and FMEA methodologies enhanced my ability to map business risks to security controls a skill that is invaluable when advising clients on governance, compliance, and digital resilience.

Moving forward, I plan to integrate quantitative risk modelling into EY’s cybersecurity assessments, particularly for clients undergoing cloud migration or digital transformation. Using Monte Carlo analysis, for example, could provide a more transparent, evidence-based rationale for prioritising investments in risk mitigation. I also intend to develop further expertise in Business Continuity Management (ISO 22301) and Zero-Trust Architecture, both of which were central to my second assessment’s recommendations.
On a personal level, the module strengthened my reflective practice the ability to analyse not just outcomes, but also the reasoning behind decisions. Applying Rolfe et al.’s model encouraged deeper introspection about my emotional responses to pressure, my evolving professional identity, and the need for continuous learning. I now recognise that effective cybersecurity management demands both analytical skill and ethical awareness.
In future academic and professional contexts, I aim to mentor peers and clients on adopting holistic risk strategies that integrate technical defence, quantitative evaluation, and organisational alignment. The transition from SME risk identification to enterprise-scale digital resilience mirrored the trajectory I aspire to follow in my career: progressing from operational assessment to strategic advisory.

Ultimately, this module has not only expanded my technical competence but also reinforced my belief that cybersecurity is a discipline rooted in collaboration, criticality, and lifelong learning. By combining structured methodologies with professional judgement, I feel better equipped to contribute meaningfully to EY’s mission of building trust in digital transformation.
